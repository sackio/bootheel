#Bootheel

Bootstrap is great for making convention-based modern web app frontends quickly. Backbone is a powerful and minimal client-side MVW framework. Bootheel combines the power of these tools to create out-of-the-box interfaces for RESTful APIs.

## The Basics

Underneath custom components, special effects, and pretty styles, most RESTful web apps boil down to controls for user input and views for rendering data. Bootheel provides:

* Create Bootstrap components with a fluid, chainable API
* Easily add custom component plugins
* Generate forms and tables from JSON objects
* Create and edit objects with form controls
* Serialize forms and fieldsets into JSON objects
* Apply model schemas to views
* Control input with path and model validators, bound to forms
* Packaged sync over http and websockets, including files

## Examples

* Schema-based, nested models with many validations
* Password and hidden fields
* File uploads
* Location
* WYSIWYG editor
* Bar codes
* Select with options from remote source
